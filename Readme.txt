Welcome to Skinaptiks
Where we bring high-fives (and sensor-fives thousand) to the world of prosthetics!

Who Are We?
We’re a team of passionate, slightly over-caffeinated engineers, devs, and dreamers convinced that prosthetics should feel less like clunky hardware and more like a natural extension of the human body. We believe in:
> Big ambitions – because playing small is for board games
> Mind-blowing tech – from software development to AI model integration, we’re all in
> Making a real difference – we want to help amputees feel comfortable, safe, and unstoppable
So basically, think Iron Man’s arm… minus the lasers. (But hey, we’re working on it.)

Our Mission
> Revolutionize prosthetics: Build sensor-laden sockets that don’t just measure pressure but also give us data about the user’s comfort in real-time
> Elevate the patient experience: Reduce endless adjustments and constant fittings with real, actionable data
> Have fun doing it: Because if you’re not having fun, are you even wearing your bunny slippers to the office?

Why Do We Need You?
Because our to-do list is longer than a CVS receipt. We have big projects cooking, from software dev to AI modeling, and we need strong arms… or rather, swift coding fingers to help us build the future of prosthetics.

We’re looking for:
> Software developers (Front/Back/Full-Stack): If you can turn coffee and code into innovative features, we want you
> AI/ML enthusiasts: Neural nets? Reinforcement learning? You speak our love language
> Embedded systems wizards: Love tinkering with sensors, microcontrollers, and weird hardware setups? Join the madness!
> Visionaries & problem-solvers: If you have grand ideas, we have a grand stage to try them out
Seriously, if you love any part of the dev or AI stack, we have a spot on our rocketship (just mind the awkward seatbelt).

What’s in It for You?
> Endless challenges – Because letting your brain idle is so last season
> Cutting-edge tech – You’ll be working on AI models, data pipelines, sensor integrations, and more. Possibly even building the next best bionic limb
> A crazy-fun team – We might break out into spontaneous hackathons, or random brainstorming sessions at 2 a.m. (Blame the coffee.)
> Impact – Every line of code you write can help someone walk more comfortably, live more freely, and smile more often

How to Contribute (and Earn Our Eternal Gratitude)
> Develop or fix something epic—or tiny. No contribution is too small (or too weird)
> Tell us more about your project
> Come talk to Us!
